**Problem Overview**

* Mobile Price Range Prediction data is a data set containing information regarding RAM, Camera, Mobile Weight, Price Range of different phones.

* Using the data given we had to build a model for predicting the price range of a mobile phone.

* To build a machine learning model, we first perform EDA with various plots for better visualization.

* And then we split it into a training set and a test set and applied various machine learning algorithms using the training data to train the model. Finally, we evaluated the model's performance on the test data to see how well it predicted sales.
